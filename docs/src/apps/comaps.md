[CoMaps](https://www.comaps.app/) is one of the many "end-user apps" that uses 100% OpenStreetMap.
Other similar apps you may know: Wikiloc, AllTrails, Komoot, BackCountry Navigator, Locus, 
OSMAnd and many more also use OSM data.

Beware: Waze, owned by Google, is not an OSM-based app!

In daily usage CoMaps is extremely handy to use as an outdoor (hiking, biking etc.) app. 
Its navigation capabilities are excellent as well, even voice-powered. You can also load hiking routes (GPX files) and
even record your own traces. 

*[CoMaps](https://www.comaps.app/) is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, 
tourists, hikers, drivers and cyclists based on OpenStreetMap data created by the community. 
It is a privacy-focused, [community-led fork of Organic Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoMaps) which in turn
is open-source fork of Maps.me app (previously known as MapsWithMe)*

*CoMaps is one of the few applications that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. 
Install CoMaps, download maps, throw away your SIM card, and go for a week-long trip on a single battery charge without any 
byte received from the network.*

## Navigation: Use case 

Especially in rural areas, CoMaps is much more powerful. See this case of pedestrian routing
from one 'cortijo' (EV) to another (G&T). Only CoMaps has all the info on unpaved tracks and even goat paths to create
the most efficient route.

## Installation

See [CoMaps website](https://www.comaps.app/). 

## Usage

* Best is to install while you are on a WIFI or have ample mobile data
* On first launch it will ask you to download the region you are in, e.g. Andalusia
* From then on you can even use the app without mobile data switched on!
* First try to orient by pushing the "location" icon at lower right of screen
* There are many advanced options, for some people CoMaps has replaced Google Maps

## Recording Tracks

A very powerful feature is that you can record your own movements while hiking, cycling etc. 
This is called "track recording". You can even collect your own Points of Interest, called "Bookmarks" while recording. 
To keep your track recordings organized CoMaps has a concept of "Lists". A single List
is basically like a "folder" in which you store your tracks and bookmarks of interest. You will find
your Lists via the bottom menu by pressing the "star" icon. Best is to create a fresh new List before recording your track.
Tracks and Bookmarks are always recorded in the "current List", which is the one on the top.

There's a YouTube video which shows the basics of track recording and dealing with Lists.
NB the video is using Organic Maps, but this works the same in CoMaps (as CoMaps is a fork of OM).
