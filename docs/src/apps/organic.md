# Organic Maps

[Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) is one of the many "end-user apps" that user 100% OpenStreetMap.
Other similar apps you may know: Wikiloc, AllTrails, Komoot, BackCountry Navigator, Locus, 
OSMAnd and many more also use OSM data.

Beware: Waze, owned by Google, is not an OSM-based app!

In daily usage it is extremely handy to use as an outdoor (hiking, biking etc) app. 
Its navigation capabilities are excellent as well, even voice powered.

*[Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) is a free Android & iOS offline maps app for travelers, 
tourists, hikers, drivers and cyclists based on OpenStreetMap data created by the community. 
It is a privacy-focused, open-source fork of Maps.me app (previously known as MapsWithMe), 
maintained by the same people who created MapsWithMe in 2011.*

*Organic Maps is one of the few applications nowadays that supports 100% of features without an active Internet connection. 
Install Organic Maps, download maps, throw away your SIM card, and go for a weeklong trip on a single battery charge without any 
byte sent to the network.*
