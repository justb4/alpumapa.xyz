# Welcome to the OpenStreetMap Workshop!

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), abbreviated as "OSM", is a free, editable map of the entire world built by volunteers. 
OSM is sometimes called "The Wikipedia of Maps". You may already use OSM
via one of the many "apps" like Komoot, Strava, Wikiloc or AllTrails.

## When is the Workshop?

For now on demand. See ['when' section](when.md)

## Why this Workshop?

OSM is important for regions
like the Alpujarra (and the world in general!) since it can provide much more detail than for example Google Maps, 
even for navigation/routing. See example below.

OSM can empower communities since they are able to map their surroundings instead of relying
on commercial map providers. Also in cases of disasters like recently [DANA in Valencia](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ES:Espa%C3%B1a/Humanitario/DANA_2024), it is important
to have accurate maps and/or be able to [jointly quickly map the region](https://tasks.hotosm.org/projects/17948).

OSM also fits in the current [Public Stack movement for 'Big Tech' alternatives](https://publicstack.net/alternatives/). Keyword here is **Empowerment**.

## About this workshop

In this workshop you will learn how to use
the various "mobile apps" to map your surroundings. 
No prior knowledge nor technical background is required. 
After an introduction we go out to map streets and local businesses together. 
Come with your smartphone. A laptop is handy but not required.
What you will learn:

- The basics of OSM, its data model, and "tagging"
- Navigating [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org)
- [Creating an OSM account](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new)
- Play with [CoMaps](https://www.comaps.app/), one of the many OSM-driven user-apps for smartphones
- Mapping with smart OSM surveyor apps: [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/?lang=nl) and [EveryDoor](https://every-door.app/)
- Meet the [worldwide](https://community.openstreetmap.org/) and [Spanish OSM community](https://openstreetmap.es)

All in due time, normally this workshop takes about 4 hours. The goal is to empower you 
as a mapper in your village/region, hopefully as regular contributor. 

A laptop is handy, but this entire workshop can be done with your smartphone.

## Course materials

This workshop includes presentation slides, which you can find 
[here as a PDF](presentation.md).

We also utilize existing OSM tutorials such as:

- [OSM Beginner's Guide Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide)
- The [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/nl_NL/) website

The [presentation slides](presentation.md) serve as the main guide. 
This website and the slides can also be used as reference material or for self-study.

## Advanced Topics

The focus of this workshop is primarily on the "smart apps."  
If time permits, participants can explore more advanced topics, including:

- Extracting data from OpenStreetMap using the OverPass (Turbo) API
- Extracting data from OpenStreetMap in QGIS
- Introduction to the ID and JOSM Editors
- Quality assurance using tools like [Osmose](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmose)
- Specific to [Spain: importing Buildings and Addresses](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Spanish_Cadastre/Buildings_import), "Edificios y Direcciones", from "Catastro"
