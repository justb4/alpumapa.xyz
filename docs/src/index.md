# Welcome to the OpenStreetMap Alpumapa Workshop!

![OpenTopoMap](assets/images/pres-front.jpg)

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), abbreviated as OSM from here, is a free, editable map of the entire world built 
by volunteers and released under an open content license (ODbL). OSM is 
sometimes called "The Wikipedia of Maps". 

"OpenStreetMap" encompasses at least three components:

- **The OSM Project**: methods, techniques, and tools (e.g., "Editors")
- **The Data**: OSM data used to create maps, such as those on openstreetmap.org
- **The Community**: the people, the "OSM Community"

## About this workshop

This is a basic workshop where you will learn:

- The basics of OSM, its data model, and "tagging"
- Navigating [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org)
- Creating an OSM account
- Play with [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/), one of the many OSM-driven user-apps for smartphones
- Mapping with smart OSM surveyor apps: [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/?lang=nl) and [EveryDoor](https://every-door.app/)
- Getting acquainted with the worldwide and Spanish OSM community and their communication channels

All in due time, normally this workshop takes about 4 hours. The goal is to empower you 
as a mapper in your village/region, hopefully as regular contributor. 

A laptop is handy, but this entire workshop can be done with your smartphone.

## Course materials

This workshop includes presentation slides, which you can find 
[here as a PDF](assets/presentations/osm-workshop-alpumapa-2025-v1.pdf).

We also utilize existing OSM tutorials such as:

- [OSM Beginner's Guide Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide)
- The [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/nl_NL/) website

The [presentation slides](assets/presentations/osm-workshop-alpumapa-2025-v1.pdf) serve as the main guide. 
This website and the slides can also be used as reference material or for self-study.
