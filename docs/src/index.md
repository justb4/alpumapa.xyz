## Welcome to the OpenStreetMap Alpumapa Workshop!

[OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org), abbreviated as OSM, is a free, editable map of the entire world built 
by volunteers and released under an open content license (ODbL).

OpenStreetMap encompasses at least three components:

- **The OSM Project**: methods, techniques, and tools (e.g., "Editors")
- **The Data**: OSM data used to create maps, such as those on openstreetmap.org
- **The Community**: the people, the "OSM Community"

## About this workshop

This is a basic workshop where you will learn:

- The basics of OSM, its data model, and "tagging"
- OSM organization: [OSMF](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- Navigating [openstreetmap.org](https://openstreetmap.org)
- Creating an OSM account
- An introduction to the iD editor
- Working with smart OSM surveyor apps: [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/?lang=nl) and [EveryDoor](https://every-door.app/)
- Getting acquainted with the OSM(-ES) community and the OSM Forum

## Course materials

This workshop includes presentation slides, which you can find 
[here as a PDF](assets/presentations/osm-workshop-alpumapa-2025-v1.pdf).

We also utilize existing OSM tutorials such as:

- [OSM Beginner's Guide Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide)
- The [LearnOSM](https://learnosm.org/nl_NL/) website

The [presentation slides](assets/presentations/osm-workshop-alpumapa-2025-v1.pdf) serve as the main guide. 
This website and the slides can also be used as reference material or for self-study.
