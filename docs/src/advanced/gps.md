# Edit with GPS Traces

In the [CoMaps](../apps/comaps.md) section we have shown how to record a GPS trace.
GPS traces can be recorded in many other ways as well. Classically [GPS Receivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation_device)
like from the brand [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/) were
used, but these days apps for the smartphone or even [GPS watches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_watch) can do the same.

In the end the main goal is to save your GPS trace as a so-called [GPX file](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GPX). A GPX file
has a universal format to interchange GPS trace or track information between geo-applications.
On [OpenStreetMap.org](https://openstreetmap.org) you can [upload GPX files](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Upload_GPS_tracks) and subsequently 
use these to draw new roads, tracks, paths. 

GPX files are also used to share hiking routes such as on AllTrails or WikiLoc. GPX-files can be opened
in for example CoMaps and used to follow a route. But here we use our own recorded GPS traces.

## Video Tutorial

Just has made a video tutorial how to:

* login on [OpenStreetMap.org](https://openstreetmap.org) (be sure to make an OSM account first)
* upload your GPS trace as a GPX file
* edit the map using the GPS trace as a background drawing

The tutorial assumes you:

* know the basics of the [OSM Id Editor](https://learnosm.org/en/beginner/id-editor/)
* have recorded a GPS trace with for example [CoMaps](../apps/comaps.md)
