These are presented as \"quests\" on the map. SC displays these \"quests\" as markers on the map. Each of these quests can be resolved on-site by answering a simple question. For example, by tapping on a marker, you might be asked, \"What is the name of this street?\" and presented with a text field to answer. More examples are shown in the screenshots below.</p> <p></p> StreetComplete Screenshots - Source: https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete <p>The user\u2019s answers are automatically processed and uploaded directly to the OSM database. Edits are submitted in meaningful changesets using the user\u2019s OSM account. Since the app is designed for field use, it can also work offline (via Settings) and is optimized to minimize data usage.</p> <p>To make the app user-friendly, the quests are limited to those that can be answered through simple questions. Here is the list of possible quests.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>Sometimes you\u2019ll encounter a situation in the field that you cannot resolve directly in StreetComplete. For example, a walking path might have been removed, or a building has been demolished. In such cases, you can leave location-bound Notes (and even photos) and later resolve them at home using an OSM editor like iD or JOSM. Don\u2019t forget to \"resolve\" the Note afterward! How to create a Note? Within SC, do a \"long press\" with your finger on the spot where you want to leave the Note. Alternatively, you can choose \"Other Answers... | Don\u2019t Know\" in the quest and create the Note there. Here you can view the latest Notes in the Netherlands, or see your own Notes in your User Profile when logged into openstreetmap.org.</p>"},{"location":"apps/streetcomplete/#team-mode","title":"Team Mode","text":"<p>There is a Team Mode for cases where multiple people are surveying the same street and want to avoid overlapping work.
